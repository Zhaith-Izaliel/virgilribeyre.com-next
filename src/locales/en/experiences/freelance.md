Software development centered around missions proposed by various customers (start-ups, SMEs, but also larger companies). The missions vary in terms of time (1 to 2 days to 6 months or more) and methods/languages (Frontend, Backend, DevOps, System, SaaS, ...). **Flexibility** is important to be able to quickly **adapt** to different development processes, strict or not, as well as ensuring consistency in your code deliveries.
