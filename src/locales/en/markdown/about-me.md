# About Me

Passionate about software development, at the age of 19 I set up my freelancing business in order to accumulate experiences in multiple aspect of software development (Web, System, DevOps, Video Games, **SaaS**, ...).

I have to be **flexible**, **autonomous** and **efficient** in order to perform my missions at best.

**Detail-oriented** and **curious**, I always look for **scalable** and simple solutions to solve a problem. Ensuring software quality along the entire pipeline is, to me, a key point in my work ethic.
