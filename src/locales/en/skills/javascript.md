Mastery in JavaScript on multiple **frameworks** (Vue.js, React, Koa.js, Express, JQuery). I practice strict code practices that I enforce using **ESLint** and **Prettier**, even to the point of pushing documentations first. I'm also working on a custom ESLint rules-set to further increase my **code quality** when working in JavaScript.
