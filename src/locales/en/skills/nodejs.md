Advanced knowledge on NodeJS, with multiple **frameworks** and **libraries** (Vue.js, React, Koa.js, Express, JQuery). I practice strict code practices that I enforce using **ESLint** and **Prettier**, even to the point of pushing documentations first. I'm also working on a custom ESLint rules-set to further increase my *code quality* when working on NodeJS projects. I can work on both JavaScript and TypeScript with NodeJS.
