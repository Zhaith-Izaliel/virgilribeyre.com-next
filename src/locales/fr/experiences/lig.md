Internship done at the LIG as a **researcher**, working on **testability**, how to measure it and how to enforce practices and coding patterns that enhance **testability** while avoiding patterns hindering it.
This Internship led to the development of an **open-source prototype Testability Linter**, similar to ESLint, available [here](https://gitlab.com/Zhaith-Izaliel/testability-linter).
