Multiple flavors of Linux have been my **personal** and **professional** OSes for **years**. I know **advanced features** of the ecosystem. I have been able to **manage** and **maintain** multiple **Linux servers**, be it **self-hosted** or as a **VPS**. Additionally, I have delved into the **kernel ABI** for personal projects. I am using NixOS as my current Linux Operating System.
